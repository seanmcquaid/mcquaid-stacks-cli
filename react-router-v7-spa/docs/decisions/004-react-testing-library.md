Status: accepted

## Context

In our development process, ensuring robust testing for our React components has become increasingly crucial. The existing testing framework has shown limitations in effectively simulating user interactions and maintaining test reliability as the project complexity grows. React Testing Library (RTL) emerges as a candidate due to its focus on testing user behavior rather than implementation details, promoting better test maintenance and more reliable outcomes.

## Decision

After thorough evaluation and consideration, the decision has been made to integrate React Testing Library as our primary testing framework for React components. RTL's philosophy aligns with our aim to create tests that mirror user experiences and reduce brittleness associated with implementation-specific testing. Its support for querying based on accessibility roles and its alignment with the React ecosystem significantly influenced this decision.

## Consequences

The adoption of React Testing Library anticipates several positive outcomes for our development process. The shift will likely result in clearer, more maintainable tests, reducing false positives and enabling faster debugging. However, this transition might require a learning curve for those unfamiliar with RTL's approach, which could initially impact productivity. Long-term benefits include improved test reliability and easier onboarding for new developers joining the project.
