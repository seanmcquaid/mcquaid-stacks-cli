# Adding Shadcn/UI Components

If you would like to add any new Shadcn/UI components to your app, you can do so by following the CLI docs [here](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/cli).

If you are too lazy to read the docs above, to get a list of all available components to add you can run the following command:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add
```
