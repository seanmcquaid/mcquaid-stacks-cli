Status: accepted

## Context

Ensuring data integrity and type safety within the project has become a critical concern. Existing validation mechanisms lack robustness and standardization, leading to potential data inconsistencies and runtime errors. Zod presents itself as a robust TypeScript-first schema validation library, providing a declarative and concise way to define and validate data schemas. Its strong TypeScript integration and comprehensive validation capabilities make it a compelling choice for the project.

## Decision

After comprehensive evaluation, the decision has been made to incorporate Zod as our primary library for schema validation and data type definitions. Zod's seamless integration with TypeScript and its ergonomic API for defining data schemas align well with the project's need for robust type safety and data validation. Its support for custom validators, error messages, and schema composition further solidified this decision.

## Consequences

The adoption of Zod is expected to bring several advantages to the project's data handling and validation process. It anticipates a significant improvement in data integrity, reducing runtime errors by catching type mismatches and validation issues during development. However, there might be a learning curve for those transitioning to Zod's validation syntax, potentially impacting initial implementation timelines. In the long run, leveraging Zod is anticipated to enhance code reliability, simplify data validation, and promote a more structured approach to handling data within the project.
