## Context

Managing forms in React applications can often lead to complex state management and boilerplate code. Existing form libraries may introduce unnecessary complexities or limitations. React Hook Form is a lightweight and performant form library that leverages React hooks, offering a simple and efficient approach to form management. Its emphasis on uncontrolled components and minimal re-renders aligns well with the project's need for streamlined form handling.

## Decision

After comprehensive evaluation, the decision has been made to adopt React Hook Form as our primary form management solution in the React application. React Hook Form's approach using hooks, minimal setup, and focus on uncontrolled components provide a more straightforward and performant way to handle forms compared to other alternatives. Its flexibility, validation options, and ease of integration further solidified this decision. We can also use a resolver to handle using Zod to define our form schemas and validate form data.

## Consequences

The adoption of React Hook Form is expected to bring numerous benefits to the project's form handling. It anticipates reduced complexity and improved performance by minimizing unnecessary re-renders and simplifying form state management. However, there might be a learning curve for those transitioning to React Hook Form, potentially impacting initial form implementations. In the long term, leveraging React Hook Form is anticipated to streamline form development, improve user experience, and enhance overall code maintainability.
