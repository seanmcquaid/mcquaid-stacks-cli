# @mcquaid-stacks/cli

Throughout my years of working in web development, I have found myself using the same tools over and over again when starting a new project. After going through the same exercise of creating a new project and setting up the same tools time and time again, I have decided to create a collection of scaffolding templates for these tools to make it easier for anyone to get started on new projects with an opinionated starter.

These templates are meant to be a starting point for new projects and are not meant to be a one-size-fits-all solution. I have created these templates to fit my needs and preferences, but I am always open to suggestions and improvements. If you have any suggestions or improvements, please feel free to open an issue on the repo!

## Scaffolding a new project 

```bash
    npx create-mcquaid-stack
```

## Current Templates

1. Vite + React
2. TypeScript Libraries

## Future Templates

1. Next.js
2. Remix
3. TanStack Router
