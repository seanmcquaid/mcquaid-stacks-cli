# Changeset

Date: YYYY-MM-DD

Status: proposed

## Context

Within any library, managing versioning and coordinating releases can be challenging. Changeset offers a structured approach to manage versioning and releases within a monorepo environment. It provides tooling to automate version bumps, generate changelogs, and coordinate releases across interconnected packages, streamlining the release process.

## Decision

After careful consideration, the proposal is to integrate Changeset as the versioning and release management tool within the project. Changeset's ability to automate versioning, generate consistent changelogs, and simplify the coordination of package releases aligns well with our need for a more structured and automated release workflow. Its support for GitHub workflows and straightforward configuration further bolsters this proposal.

## Consequences

The adoption of Changeset is anticipated to bring several benefits to the project. It expects to streamline versioning and release coordination, reducing manual effort in managing package versions and release notes. However, there might be a learning curve for those new to Changeset, potentially impacting initial implementation timelines. In the long term, leveraging Changeset is expected to enhance our release process, improve version consistency, and facilitate smoother coordination across package releases within our monorepo.
