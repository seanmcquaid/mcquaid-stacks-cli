# Vitest

Date: 2023-12-27

Status: proposed

## Context

In our JavaScript project, we are exploring an efficient and modern unit test runner that aligns well with the Vite ecosystem. Vitest, built on top of Vite, offers a streamlined and performant solution for running unit tests in JavaScript projects. Leveraging the speed and module-based architecture of Vite, Vitest aims to provide a fast and developer-friendly environment for writing and executing unit tests.

## Decision

After initial exploration and evaluation, we propose adopting Vitest as the primary unit test runner for our JavaScript projects built with Vite. Vitest's integration with Vite's module system, quick test execution, and developer-centric features make it an appealing choice to streamline our unit testing workflow. Its compatibility with modern JavaScript features and seamless integration within the Vite ecosystem influenced this proposed decision.

## Consequences

If accepted, the adoption of Vitest is anticipated to bring several benefits to our JavaScript projects. It expects to offer faster test execution times, a more developer-friendly testing experience, and improved compatibility with Vite's module-based architecture. However, there might be a learning curve for team members transitioning to Vitest, potentially impacting initial test implementation timelines. In the long run, leveraging Vitest is expected to enhance our unit testing practices and improve overall code quality.
