# Zod

## Context

Zod is a TypeScript-first schema validation library. It is incredibly flexible and can be used for validating any type of data in your application.

## Decision

I recommend using Zod for the following use cases to allow for better type safety and more robust validation:

1. Form validation
2. Declaring API types + API validation in the service level
3. URL Query Params validation
4. Validating your .env file

Essentially, Zod can be used for any type of data validation in your application where you are dealing with something you don't directly control. You don't control the data coming from a form, you don't necessarily control the data coming from an API, you don't control the data coming from the URL, and you don't control the data coming from your .env file.

## Consequences

Developers will need to learn Zod. There is a bit of a learning curve to it but the benefits of runtime validation are HUGE.
