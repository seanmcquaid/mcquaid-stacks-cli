## Context

The current suite for end-to-end testing has revealed limitations in accurately simulating user interactions across different browsers and devices. Additionally, maintaining these tests to ensure reliability has become challenging due to the frequent changes in the application's UI/UX. Playwright emerges as a promising solution due to its multi-browser support, robust API, and ability to handle complex scenarios, addressing the shortcomings of our existing testing suite.

## Decision

Following comprehensive evaluation and analysis, the decision has been made to incorporate Playwright as our primary framework for end-to-end testing. Playwright's capability to test across multiple browsers and its straightforward API align well with our goal of creating reliable end-to-end tests that can adapt to various environments. Furthermore, its support for headless execution and the ability to simulate complex user interactions were key factors in this decision. We can use our Mock Service Worker handlers to mock API requests as needed.

## Consequences

The adoption of Playwright is expected to yield several positive outcomes for our testing practices. It anticipates more comprehensive test coverage across different browsers and devices, improving the overall reliability and stability of the project. However, there might be a temporary slowdown in test development initially, as the team familiarizes themselves with Playwright's syntax and capabilities. Long-term benefits include reduced maintenance overhead and more robust end-to-end tests, contributing to enhanced product quality.
