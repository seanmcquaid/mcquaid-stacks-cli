## Context

While the browser's Fetch API has improved significantly over the years, it still has some shortcomings. In order to achieve retries, timeouts, and many other features with the Fetch API, you need to write a lot of boilerplate code. This is where Ky comes in.

Ky is a lightweight HTTP client based on the browser Fetch API. It's a great alternative to Axios as it is being built on top of the Web APIs for Requests and Responses as opposed to Axios' usage of XMLHttpRequest.

## Decision

I recommend using Ky as the HTTP client for all of our projects. Based on my previous experimentation, it plays well with React Server Components because it is built on top of the Fetch API. I am a fan of the API client pattern and Ky is a great fit for that.

## Consequences

Minimal as Ky is a very lightweight library built on the Fetch API. If anything, it will force developers to become more familiar with the standard Web APIs for Requests, Responses and Fetch.
