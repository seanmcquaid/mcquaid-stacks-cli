# i18next

## Context

Internationalization is a common requirement for web applications.

## Decision

I recommend using i18next along with react-i18next for internationalization in your web applications. Both are mature libraries with a large community and are well maintained.

## Consequences

The main consequence of using i18next is that you will need to learn how to use the library and be bvery vigilant with translating all text. However, linting rules have been included in the project to help with this. I have also provided a recommended folder structure for organizing your translations.
