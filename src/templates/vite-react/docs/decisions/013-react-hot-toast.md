## Context

Managing notifications within the project has proven to be a challenging aspect. The existing notification system lacks flexibility, making it difficult to create dynamic, user-friendly alerts. React Hot Toast emerges as a potential solution due to its simplicity, customizability, and ease of integration within React applications. Its support for various types of notifications and customizable behavior aligns with our need for a more versatile notification management system.

## Decision

After thorough evaluation and consideration, the decision has been made to integrate React Hot Toast as our notification management library. React Hot Toast's intuitive API, flexibility in designing different notification types, and seamless integration with React were key factors influencing this decision. Its ability to manage various notification scenarios, including success messages, errors, warnings, and custom notifications, offers the versatility the project requires.

## Consequences

The adoption of React Hot Toast is expected to bring several advantages to the project. It anticipates a significant improvement in the user experience through more informative and visually appealing notifications. However, there might be a short-term impact on development velocity as the team adapts to the new library and customizes notification styles. In the long run, the streamlined notification management provided by React Hot Toast is anticipated to enhance user engagement and simplify the addition of new notification features.
