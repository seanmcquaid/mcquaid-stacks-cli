Status: accepted

## Context

Maintaining consistent code formatting and adhering to coding standards has been a challenge within the project. Inconsistent code styles across different contributors have led to readability issues and increased code review overhead. Prettier and ESLint present as powerful tools to address these concerns. Prettier offers automated code formatting, while ESLint provides a customizable linting framework to enforce coding standards and catch potential errors.

## Decision

After comprehensive evaluation and discussions, the decision has been made to integrate Prettier for code formatting and ESLint for code linting into the project workflow. Prettier's ability to automatically format code according to predefined rules will streamline the codebase and minimize debates over formatting preferences. ESLint, with its extensive rule set and customizability, will enforce coding standards, catch common errors, and encourage best practices across the development team.

## Consequences

The adoption of Prettier and ESLint is expected to bring numerous benefits to our development process. It anticipates a significant improvement in code readability, consistency, and maintainability by enforcing a unified code style. However, there might be a short-term impact on development velocity as the team adjusts to the new tools and resolves existing code inconsistencies. In the long run, the integration of Prettier and ESLint is anticipated to streamline code reviews, reduce technical debt, and enhance overall code quality.
