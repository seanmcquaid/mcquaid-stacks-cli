Status: accepted

## Context

Our React application requires client-side routing to manage navigation and handle different views within the application. The current navigation setup, primarily reliant on manual state management or simpler routing solutions, lacks the robustness and flexibility needed for our project's navigation requirements. React Router emerges as a mature and widely adopted solution for client-side routing in React applications, offering comprehensive routing capabilities and seamless integration with React components.

## Decision

After careful evaluation, the decision has been made to integrate React Router as our client-side routing solution for the React application. React Router's extensive features, including declarative routing, nested route structures, dynamic routing capabilities, and easy-to-understand API, align well with our project's navigation needs. Its established community support and active maintenance further solidified this decision.

## Consequences

The adoption of React Router anticipates several positive outcomes for our application's navigation and user experience. It expects to provide a robust and maintainable routing solution, enabling smooth navigation between different views while maintaining the single-page application experience. However, there might be a learning curve for team members new to React Router, impacting initial development velocity. In the long term, the integration of React Router is anticipated to enhance navigation flexibility, simplify route management, and improve overall user interaction within the application.
