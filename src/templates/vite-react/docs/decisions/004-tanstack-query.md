## Context

Managing asynchronous data fetching and state management in complex React applications can become intricate and error-prone. Existing solutions often involve a mix of various libraries or homebrew code, leading to increased complexity and potential inconsistencies in data handling. TanStack Query is a comprehensive data fetching and state management solution for React applications. Its ability to simplify data fetching, caching, and state management while leveraging React hooks and providing TypeScript support aligns with the project's need for a robust yet simplified data layer.

## Decision

We will use TanStack Query as our primary solution for data fetching and state management in React applications. TanStack Query's declarative approach using hooks, the built-in caching mechanism, and its seamless integration with React make it an ideal fit for the project's requirements. Additionally, its support for TypeScript and well-documented API further solidified this decision.

## Consequences

Utilizing TanStack Query will ultimately lead to a reduction in boilerplate code related to data fetching and state management, improved performance through efficient caching, and enhanced developer experience with a simplified and consistent API. However, there might be a learning curve for those new to TanStack Query, potentially impacting initial development. In the long term, leveraging TanStack Query is anticipated to streamline data management, improve scalability, and maintain a more organized and predictable server state management within the project.
