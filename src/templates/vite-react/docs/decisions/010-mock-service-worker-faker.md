# Mock Service Worker + Faker

Date: 2023-12-27

Status: accepted

## Context

Our frontend development workflow requires a robust solution for mocking API endpoints during development and testing phases. Creating a dependable, consistent environment for testing frontend components reliant on backend services has proven challenging. Mock Service Worker (MSW), combined with Faker, offers an efficient way to mock API endpoints and generate realistic mock data dynamically. MSW intercepts and manages network requests, while Faker provides customizable fake data generation, enabling more comprehensive and reliable frontend testing.

## Decision

After thorough evaluation, the decision has been made to incorporate Mock Service Worker along with Faker as our solution for mocking API endpoints and generating mock data in the frontend environment. We can even use our own Zod schema's to produce the mock data. MSW's ability to intercept and mock network requests seamlessly, coupled with Faker's versatility in creating realistic mock data, aligns with the project's need for effective frontend testing without direct backend dependencies. Their ease of integration and configuration further solidified this decision.

## Consequences

The adoption of Mock Service Worker and Faker is expected to yield several benefits to our frontend development and testing processes. It anticipates more reliable frontend testing by providing a controlled environment for API mocking and generating realistic mock data. However, there might be a learning curve for those new to Mock Service Worker and Faker, potentially impacting initial implementation timelines. In the long term, leveraging these tools is anticipated to enhance testing efficiency, reduce dependency on backend services during frontend development, and improve overall code quality.
