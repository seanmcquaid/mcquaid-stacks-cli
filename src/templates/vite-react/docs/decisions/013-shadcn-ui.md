# Shadcn/ui

Date: 2023-12-28

Status: accepted

## Context

In our UI development process, achieving flexibility, accessibility, and consistency across components is crucial. "shadcn/ui" emerges as a headless component library built on top of Radix UI, offering a collection of customizable and accessible UI primitives. Leveraging the headless nature of Radix UI, "shadcn/ui" provides flexible components that can be styled and adapted to diverse UI requirements without imposing a specific visual design.

## Decision

After initial exploration and evaluation, we propose integrating "shadcn/ui" as a headless component library for our UI development. Its foundation on Radix UI's principles of accessibility and low-level styling, combined with the flexibility to customize components as needed, aligns with the project's goal of building adaptable and accessible user interfaces. The headless nature of these components allows for a higher degree of customization and facilitates a consistent UI development approach.

## Consequences

If accepted, the adoption of "shadcn/ui" is anticipated to bring several benefits to our UI development process. It expects to offer a higher level of customization, accessibility, and consistency across components while maintaining a headless and adaptable approach. However, there might be a learning curve for those unfamiliar with Radix UI or headless component libraries, potentially impacting initial implementation timelines. In the long term, leveraging "shadcn/ui" is expected to enhance our UI development practices and contribute to building more flexible and accessible user interfaces.
