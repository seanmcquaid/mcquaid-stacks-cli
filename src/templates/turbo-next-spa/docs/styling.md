# Styling

Styling preferences are incredibly personal to each developer or team. This scaffolding template is using shadcn/ui and tailwind-css as the default styling solution because I believe it offers you the most flexibility out of the box with reasonably good defaults for accessibility. However, you can easily swap it out for your preferred styling solution and component library!
