## Context

In our web development workflow, ensuring consistent and efficient styling while maintaining flexibility has become a priority. Traditional CSS methodologies might introduce verbosity or limitations in managing styles across the application. Tailwind CSS presents itself as a utility-first CSS framework, offering a pragmatic and scalable approach to styling by utilizing utility classes to build interfaces quickly and maintainably.

## Decision

After thorough evaluation, the decision has been made to integrate Tailwind CSS as the primary styling framework in our web development projects. Tailwind CSS's utility classes, rapid prototyping capabilities, and extensibility align well with our need for a scalable and maintainable styling solution. Its ability to streamline the styling process while providing a flexible foundation for customizations further solidified this decision.

## Consequences

The adoption of Tailwind CSS is expected to bring several advantages to our web development projects. It anticipates faster development cycles through the use of utility classes, improved consistency in styling across the application, and reduced maintenance overhead. However, there might be a learning curve for those new to Tailwind CSS, potentially impacting initial implementation timelines. In the long run, leveraging Tailwind CSS is anticipated to enhance productivity, streamline styling workflows, and foster maintainable and consistent UI designs.
