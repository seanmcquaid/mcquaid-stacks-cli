Status: accepted

## Context

The project requires a reliable and flexible HTTP client to handle network requests. The native Fetch API, while powerful, lacks certain conveniences and flexibility, leading to boilerplate code and potential inconsistencies across network requests. Ky, a lightweight and feature-rich library, offers a modern alternative that simplifies HTTP requests, provides useful features like retries, timeouts, and automatic JSON parsing, and ensures a consistent and ergonomic API for handling network operations.

## Decision

After thorough evaluation and discussions, the decision has been made to adopt Ky as our primary HTTP client for handling network requests within the project. Ky's promise-based API and modern features align with our goal of improving code readability, reducing boilerplate, and standardizing network request handling across the codebase. Its ease of use and support for various environments, including browsers and Node.js, further solidified this decision.

## Consequences

The integration of Ky is expected to bring several benefits to the project's network request handling. It anticipates a significant reduction in boilerplate code and improved readability by providing a consistent and concise syntax for making HTTP requests. However, there might be a short-term impact on development velocity as you adapt to Ky's API and transitions existing network request code. In the long run, leveraging Ky is anticipated to streamline network operations, enhance error handling, and improve the overall maintainability of the project
