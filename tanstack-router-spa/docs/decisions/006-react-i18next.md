Status: accepted

## Context

The project needs to support multiple languages and provide a seamless internationalization experience for users. Managing translations and language-specific content manually across the application can be cumbersome and error-prone. i18next, in combination with react-i18next, is a widely adopted and feature-rich internationalization library for React applications. It offers a robust solution for managing translations, handling language switching, and integrating seamlessly with React components.

## Decision

After thorough evaluation, the decision has been made to incorporate i18next along with react-i18next as our primary internationalization solution for the React application. i18next's comprehensive features for managing translations, pluralization, interpolation, and formatting align with the project's need for a reliable and flexible internationalization library. The seamless integration of react-i18next with React components and hooks further solidified this decision.

## Consequences

The adoption of i18next and react-i18next is expected to bring several benefits to the project's internationalization efforts. It anticipates streamlined management of translations, enabling easier updates and additions of new languages or content. However, there might be a learning curve for those unfamiliar with i18next's syntax and configuration, potentially impacting initial implementation timelines. In the long run, leveraging i18next and react-i18next is anticipated to enhance user experience, broaden the application's accessibility, and simplify the process of maintaining multilingual content.
